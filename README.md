## üìñ About The Project

**Calabar Eats** is a modern, full-stack, and real-time multi-tenant food and grocery delivery platform. It serves as a centralized marketplace connecting consumers, vendors, and dispatch riders, providing a seamless e-commerce experience for the local Calabar market.

The application is engineered to solve the fragmentation in the on-demand delivery sector by creating a unified ecosystem where users can browse various stores, vendors can manage their operations, and dispatchers can efficiently handle deliveries.

This project is a high-fidelity prototype built with a robust and scalable technology stack, showcasing modern web architecture, real-time database integration, and a complex multi-user software system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calabar-eats.git
    cd calabar-eats
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**
    a. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    b. In your project, go to **Project settings** and add a new web app.
    c. Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy this object.
    d. In the root of this project, navigate to `src/lib/firebase.ts`.
    e. **Replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object** with the one from your Firebase project.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

### Seeding the Database

To get started with mock data, you can seed your Firestore database.

1.  After starting the application, log in as an admin user.
    *   **Note:** You can manually create an admin user in your Firebase Authentication console and then create a corresponding document in your `users` collection in Firestore with the `role` field set to `'admin'`.
2.  Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and go to the **Seed Data** page (`/admin/seed`).
3.  Click the "Seed Database" button. This will populate your database with mock vendors, products, users, and orders.
