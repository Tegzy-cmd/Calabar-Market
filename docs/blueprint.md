## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated orange (#F26419) to convey energy, freshness and call attention to CTAs.
- Background color: Light orange (#F9E9E1), a very lightly saturated tint of the primary color, in keeping with a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Yellow (#F2B705), an analogous hue to orange that differs enough in brightness and saturation for contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use clean and modern icons to represent different food and grocery categories, as well as order status updates.
- Design a grid-based layout with clear sections for browsing products, order details, and vendor information.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience when navigating and interacting with the app.
